# This script will take files in ../to_package/ and package them for solder upload
# The script takes a mod, looks at the file name, creates a folder named mods/ 
# and inserts the jarfile into it while keeping the version number and 
# creates a zipfile of the mods/ folder with the modname.

# Example: ../to_package/FastLeafDecay-1.7.10-1.0.jar and outputs it as FastLeafDecay-1.7.10-1.0.zip
